I set this project up using expo, react native, and typescript. 

I ran this project using "expo start --web"

The styles were set to mobile and using an iPhone 12 pro

The search returns an infinite scrolling experience the first time the page is loaded but then only returns 30 images if there is a search done without refreshing the page.

When an image is selected on it shows the alone image and gives all the image details below.

The filters are applied after the search is done and the filter button has been selected. 

There are 3 errors that I ran out of time troubleshooting:
1 x photoDetailPage.tsx
2 x photoSearch.tsx

The download doesn't work although I did get it started, I ran out of time to get that part completed. 

The styles aren't as polished as I would like either. 

I would also liked to have gotten the some tests added to the project.

I've also got one of these console errors that needs to be fixed:
react-dom.development.js:86 Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `.$5APBLfC2hUs`. 
Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. 
Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” 
the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
